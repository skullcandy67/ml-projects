#  🧪logS Prediction Model
A machine learning model to predict aqueous solubility (logS) based on molecular descriptors.


# 📝 Description
This project builds a regression model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using descriptors such as:

MolLogP (lipophilicity measure)

MolWt (molecular weight)

NumRotatableBonds (flexibility indicator)

AromaticProportion (aromaticity fraction)

The model is trained using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to analyze the relationship between molecular properties and solubility.


# 🚀 Features
🧑‍🔬 Feature Engineering to process molecular descriptors.

📊 Model Training using regression techniques.

🏆 Performance Evaluation with RMSE & R² scores.

🌐 Deployment Ready using Flask for API integration.


# 📜 License
This project is open-source and available for collaboration.
